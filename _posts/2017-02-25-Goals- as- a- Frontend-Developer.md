Coming into the industry of Frontend development I have many goals that, overtime, I want to accomplish. One goal would be to find a good job that I can make a career out of. I want something that pushes me and allows for personal growth. Finding world that I feel passionate about and that I find rewarding is ideal. 

Secondly, finding a job working in the Mobile area of the web-development industry would be ideal. I welcome any industry to begin with as, I am willing to start anywhere, but have found this industry vertical to be of most interest to me thus far. 

Third, would be to find a sense of self-fulfillment and accomplishment. This is something that is very important to me, as I have yet to find this in my professional life. Working in an area that gives me a sense of pride and satisfaction is idyllic.

Fourth, coming out of my schooling with confidence in my abilities as a web-developer means a great deal to me. I believe that confidence is one of the keys to being successful in anything you do. I want to display confidence in my comfort with developing. 

Fifth, I would also like to work with non-profits, in helping them with their web development needs. My father as a non-profit organization. I help in any way I can in other areas currently, but would love to be able to him on the development side of things.

Lastly, a huge goal of mine is to keep an open mind and continue to embrace and learn new concepts and ideas. In this industry there is always room to grow and expand. It is ever changing and there is always something more you can learn and expose yourself to.
