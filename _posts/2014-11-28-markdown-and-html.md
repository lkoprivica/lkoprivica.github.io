title: My Experience with Bloc
---

I was enrolled to begin a Masters Program in the field of Web-Development when I found Bloc. I was considering about the amount of time it would take to finish the program, and so decided on doing some research on programs that moved at a faster pace and would allow me to begin my career sooner rather than later. This is when I found Bloc. After reading reviews and talking to my husband and my Father, who has been in education for over 15 years, I knew that this was the direction to take. I withdrew from my masters classes, enrolled in Bloc and began shortly after. 

Beginning Bloc was thrilling and nerve racking all at the same time. The days leading up to my first day with the Bloc program were filled with anxiety and excitement. I felt anxious as I was not sure how much of a challenge I was taking on, nor did I know exactly what to expect. But, I was also beyond excited to begin a program that would allow me to work in a career that I enjoy; something that I had begun to feel would never transpire. 
 
They were not joking when they said as a student in this program I would spending close to 20 hours a week working on the course material. Quite the work load, but with good support from the people around me, prioritizing and good planning, completely manageable. Progressing through the program I encountered many challenges and stumbling blocks, but with the support of my program mentor and determination, I tackled them and continued to move forward.  

Many things in life happen unexpectedly. A few months into the program, my husband and I found that we were pregnant with our first child. We were of course, extremely excited. My track with this program was perfect timing, as I would finish about a month or so before the baby comes; or so I thought. I had an extreme case of morning-sickness, which in my particular situation, I would call “all-day-sickness”, that pushed me to freeze my program and put me over 20% behind. This was extremely discouraging for me. I was feeling great, working hard, had a great routine down and then the unexpected happened. Coming out of the first 14 weeks of my pregnancy, I found it very difficult to find my motivation again and dive back in. I had to go back a review and redo some work as I had forgotten quite a bit. I did eventually find my groove again, but it was a fight.
 
As I write this blog post, I am still pregnant and going through this program. I can happily say I have found my motivation again. I am feeling considerably better and am working diligently to catch up. My schedule for school at the moment, involves me working 30+ hours a week. Very overwhelming at times, but I know it will be well worth it in the end. I will have a great career path ahead of me and my first baby girl to boot. My best advice at this point would be to embrace life and anything it throws at you; never let it discourage or keep you from pursuing your passion.
