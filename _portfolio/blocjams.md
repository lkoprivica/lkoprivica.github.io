Bloc-Jams Project

Summary:

Listening to music is a past-time the majority of individuals enjoy. I began working on Bloc-Jams as my very first project associated with my web development schooling.  Bloc-Jams is meant to permit users to choose the kind of music they prefer, it also allows for unlimited streaming and is made to allow the user to use it across multiple platforms.  

Explanation:

This particular project, like mentioned in the summary, was my very first project. I completed this project along with the guidance of my web development program mentor. I developed bloc-jams from beginning to end and was responsible for all aspects of the website. 

Conclusion:

This being my first project, upon completion, I felt I learned an extensive amount. I learned patience and persistence were keys to me being successful in the final completion of this product. I am happy with it but looking forward to the next project and how I can be even more effective moving forward.
